Description: The aim of 'SEAA' is to provide convenient and rapid splicing 
    efficiency calculation and splicing sites annotation function using next 
    generation sequencing data. Aligned files and a processed splicing sites 
    annotation file are needed. The task can be finished in several minutes 
    using multi-core computing with the assistance of 'Rsubread'. Plots of 
    splicing status type and Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) and 
    annotated valid splicing efficiency can be exported.
